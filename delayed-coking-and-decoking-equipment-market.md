<p><p>Delayed coking is a vital refining process used to convert heavy feedstocks into lighter hydrocarbons and valuable petroleum products like gasoline and diesel. This process involves heating the feedstock in a coker unit, where it experiences thermal cracking at high temperatures, leading to the formation of coke, which serves as a solid carbon byproduct. Decoking equipment is essential for removing and managing the accumulated coke from the coker, ensuring continuous operation of the unit.</p><p>The Delayed Coking and Decoking Equipment Market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 13% during the forecast period. This growth is driven by rising global energy demand, the increasing need for refining heavier crude oils, and the expanding petrochemical sector. Additionally, advancements in technology and equipment efficiency contribute significantly to market expansion. Recent trends indicate a push towards more environmentally friendly operations and innovations focused on minimizing emissions and improving safety during the decoking process. As refineries seek to enhance productivity and sustainability, investments in delayed coking technologies are expected to surge, further propelling the market forward and adapting to evolving industry standards.</p></p>
